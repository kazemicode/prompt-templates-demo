It\\\\’s important to understand the features of each connection type in order to select the most appropriate one for your use case. One important distinction is who is responsible for the identity lifecycle of your users. The identity lifecycle is the process of creating and maintaining your users\\\\' digital identity. This is a continuous process that includes onboarding, assigning resources, authentication, and updating and maintaining credentials and profile attributes. The identity lifecycle ends when a user's digital identity is permanently deleted. The entity responsible for the identity lifecycle is the Identity Provider (IdP). You may choose to manage the identity lifecycle of your users by using Auth0 as your IdP.
