    "• Keeping the database online and publicly available\n",

    "users from your existing database to Auth0's user store: bulk migration and automatic migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulk migration\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk migration strategy allows users to be migrated into Auth0 all at once. The bulk migration \n",
    "service supports importing passwords hashed with a number of standard hashing algorithms including bcrypt. \n",
    "The imported hash value is used only the first time the migrated user authenticates through Auth0. \n",
    "Once that happens, the user's password is hashed with Auth0's default algorithm, bcrypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulk migration can be performed using one of two methods:\n",
    "- the Auth0 Management API\n",
    "- the User Import/Export Users Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "Both solutions require a specifically formatted JSON schema representing the users you would like to import. \n",

    "\n",
    "Auth0 Management API:\n",
    "- Invoke the users-imports endpoint, passing the JSON file of user profiles.\n",
    "- Most flexible; you can implement a machine-to-machine application with custom logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import/Export Users Extension:\n",
    "- Install the extension to your tenant from the Extensions page of your Auth0 dashboard.\n",
    "- Use the extension's UI to upload the JSON file of user profiles.\n",
    "- Least flexible; limited to functionality of the extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic migration\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic migration (also called lazy or trickle migration) migrates users individually as they sign in. \n",
    "This requires keeping both the Auth0 user store and your legacy database alive during the migration period.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user logs in through Auth0:\n",
    "- If the user does not exist in Auth0, credentials are checked against the external database.\n",
    "- If valid, username and hashed password are stored in Auth0 for future logins.\n",

    "This involves:\n",
    "- Creating a custom database connection in Auth0\n",
    "- Enabling \"Import Users to Auth0\" in the connection's Settings tab\n",

    "- Verifies the user in the legacy database when not found in Auth0\n",
